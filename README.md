Startup Pitch Deck Analyzer

This project is a NLP-powered pitch deck analyzer that extracts text from PDF presentations, summarizes the content, performs sentiment analysis, and assigns heuristic scores to key startup evaluation dimensions (team, product, market, traction, and technology moat).

It is designed to help investors, accelerators, and analysts quickly evaluate startup pitch decks.

Features

Extracts text from PDF and PPTX files

Cleans and preprocesses raw text

Summarizes pitch decks using BART-large-cnn

Performs full-text sentiment analysis

Embedding support with SentenceTransformers + FAISS

Heuristic scoring for startup evaluation criteria

Highlights risks and suggests next steps

Outputs structured results in pandas DataFrames

Option to generate a sample positive pitch deck (PDF)
